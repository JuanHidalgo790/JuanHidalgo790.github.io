👨🏻‍💻 I am a doctor in mechanical engineering and an enthusiast of computational modeling for diverse engineering problems. 

🔬 My research interests are in the development of numerical models for solving acoustic problems, mainly looking to the economy in the usage of computational resources.

📚 I am currently working with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in my post-doctoral research, aiming to improve their designs.
