👨🏻‍💻 I am a doctor in mechanical engineering and an enthusiast of computational modeling for diverse engineering problems. 

🔬 My research interests are in the development of numerical models for solving acoustic problems, mainly focusing on the economy's use of computational resources.

📚 I am currently working with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in my post-doctoral research, aiming to improve their designs.

🧪 Some of my previous creations will be featured on this webpage.

🛠 This page is under construction... so soon, more content will be available!

# Some modeling examples

Here, I leave some examples that were constructed during these recent years. Next, each of them will be depicted, and their challenges will be discussed as well.  

## Modeling of an oil well under acoustic logging

This model was developed during my doctorate, and was part of a challenging project which consisted in the development of AI models for identifying the integrity of the annular cement of oil wells, based on acoustic logging data. 

So, the model consists of a section of an oil well that undergoes an inspection analysis using acoustic waves. Therefore, an acoustic signal is generated inside the inner tube, at the upper part, and guided waves follow downwards, carrying information from the layers, including those of the cement.
