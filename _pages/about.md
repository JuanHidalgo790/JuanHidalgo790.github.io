👨🏻‍💻 I am a doctor in mechanical engineering and an enthusiast of computational modeling for diverse engineering problems. 

🔬 My research interests are in the development of numerical models for solving acoustic problems, mainly focusing on the economy's use of computational resources.

📚 I am currently working with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in my post-doctoral research, aiming to improve their designs.

🧪 Some of my previous creations will be featured on this webpage.

🛠 This page is under construction... so soon, more content will be available!

# Some modeling examples

Here, I leave some examples that were constructed during these recent years. Next, each of them will be depicted, and their challenges will be discussed as well.  

## Modeling of an oil well under acoustic logging
