Here, equations and modeling examples are intended to be here soon...

## Acoustic Waves 


## Piezoelectric Effect

![Image of the piezoelectric effect](/images/PiezoEffectJuan.png){: .align-center width="800px"}


The governing equations for piezoelectric materials are given by (stress-charge form):

$$
\displaylines{
\mathbf{D}&=\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\varepsilon}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{e}\boldsymbol{:}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, \label{eq:const_piez_D}\\
\boldsymbol{\sigma}&=-{\mathbf{e}}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{c}^{E}\boldsymbol{:}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
}
$$

where \\(\mathbf{D}\\) is the electric displacement vector, \\(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\\) is the dielectric permittivity second order tensor, \\(\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field vector, and \\(\mathbf{e}\\) represents the piezoelectric coupling third order tensor, with components being _piezoelectric stress constants_. The superscripts \\(\varepsilon\\) and \\(E\\) were added to the dielectric permittivity tensor  \\(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\\) and to the elastic tensor \\(\mathbf{c}\\) to indicate that their components are measured under conditions of constant strain and constant electric field, respectively. 


## Cylindrical Waves 

An so we have the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates:

$$
\displaylines{
\frac{\partial^{2}u_{r}}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r}u_{r}\right)-\frac{1}{c_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}u_{r}}{\partial t^{2}}=0
}
$$
